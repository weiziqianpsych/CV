\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{2cm} p{0.1cm} X}

    2021-2022 & \multicolumn{2}{X}{\textbf{Effects of reading purposes on integration from multiple documents: Evidence from concept network analysis}} \\
    & $\circ$ & MA thesis \\
    & $\circ$ & Conducted three online experiments to measure different aspects of integration \\
    & $\circ$ & Converted participants' summaries to networks via a self-made Python package\\
    & $\circ$ & Found that whereas reading purpose conditions influence the \textit{inclination} of integration, the \textit{quality} of integration was difficult to improve  \\

    2020-2021 & \multicolumn{2}{X}{\textbf{Thinking patterns influence knowledge structure construction}} \\
    & $\circ$ & Drafted a proposal and received funding from The Innovative Research Foundation for Postgraduates, School of Psychology, SCNU \\
    & $\circ$ & Conducted an online experiment and recruited 120+ participants  \\
    & $\circ$ & Performed data processing and statistical analysis using Python and R \\
    
    2020 & \multicolumn{2}{X}{\textbf{Personal topic interest, generative concept sorting, and external structure information}} \\
    & $\circ$ & Wrote an application form for ethical approval \\
    & $\circ$ & Conducted two online experiments and performed statistical analysis using SPSS and JASP \\
    & $\circ$ & Found that concept maps led to better comprehension compared with outlines \\

    2019 & \multicolumn{2}{X}{\textbf{Facial identification in different visual fields}} \\
    & $\circ$ & Coursework of the postgraduate module \textit{Research Method in Psychology}. Lecturer: Prof. Ming Meng \\ 
    & $\circ$ & Arranged the whole study as a team leader \\
    & $\circ$ & Used Matlab to process a hundred and twelve pictures of facial expressions into different spatial frequencies as visual stimuli \\
    & $\circ$ & Designed an academic poster, gave an oral report, and wrote a 3,000+ words course paper, all these works were done in English \\
    

    2018-2019 & \multicolumn{2}{X}{\textbf{The effect of self-depletion on information avoidance in decision making}} \\
    & $\circ$ & BA thesis \\
    % & $\circ$ & Generated the research idea and designed experiments independently by reviewing publications \\
    & $\circ$ & Designed the experiment using E-Prime and performed statistical analysis using SPSS \\
